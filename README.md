**Title:** Classification of Clients using Python

**Description:** This project aims to classify clients based on their characteristics and predict the likelihood of default payment. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and evaluates their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Code Overview:**

The code is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The code loads the client data from an Excel file and preprocesses it by selecting the most relevant features.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The code trains multiple machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) on the preprocessed data and evaluates their performance using various metrics.
3. **Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:** The code generates a confusion matrix and classification report for each model to visualize its performance.
4. **ROC-AUC Curve:** The code calculates the ROC-AUC score for each model to evaluate its performance.
5. **Plotting Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score:** The code plots the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model to visualize their performance.

**Results:**

The code produces several outputs, including:

1. **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each model.
2. **Classification Report:** A report showing the precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.
3. **ROC-AUC Curve:** A curve showing the trade-off between false positive rate and true positive rate for each model.
4. **Plotting Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score:** A plot showing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model.

**Note:**

This project is a demonstration of machine learning classification using Python. The code can be modified and extended to suit specific use cases and requirements.
